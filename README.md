# JavaScript Quiz App using OpenTrivia API

I have used OpenTrivia API to create a simple Javascript app for sharpening my JavaScript skills. 
OpenTrivia API: https://opentdb.com/api_config.php

The user has option to select which cateogry they want to take the quiz. Once the user selects the category the app will fetch the quiz data for the cateogry and display the questions one by one.
